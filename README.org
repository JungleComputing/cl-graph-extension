#+title: An Extension for ~cl-graph~

* Introduction

This is a small package that extends the Common Lisp package ~cl-graph~ a bit.
It adds a check for equality and edges and a closure that works for directed
graphs.  Since this code, uses two functions that are virtually the same as in
the original ~cl-graph~, we use the same license as ~cl-graph~ and also add
their copyright preambles.  The code is written in [[https://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]] that exports to
the actual Common Lisp code and documentation.

* License

The code has been released under the same license as ~cl-graph~.
